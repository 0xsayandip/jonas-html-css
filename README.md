## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository contains all my code, notes, and projects from the **[Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)** course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I’m documenting my learning process here — from basic HTML structure to advanced responsive layouts and CSS animations.
Each section is organized for clarity, so anyone following along can learn or review efficiently.
